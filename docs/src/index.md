VBA Monologger is an advanced and flexible logging solution for VBA (*Visual Basic for Applications*) ecosystem. It is largely inspired by the [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) library in PHP, which itself is inspired by the [Logbook](https://logbook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library in Python.
