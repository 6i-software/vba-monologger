> VBA Monologger is an advanced and flexible logging solution for VBA (*Visual Basic for Applications*) ecosystem. It is largely inspired by the [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) library in PHP, which itself is inspired by the [Logbook](https://logbook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library in Python.


## Preamble

VBA provides developers with the ability to automate tasks, interact with the features of 
Microsoft Office applications, and even create applications with a graphical user interface (`Userform`). However, compared to other development ecosystems, VBA only offers a rudimentary logging solution, limited to the `Debug.Print` function, which writes to the Excel console (a.k.a. the Excel immediate window).

The *VBA Monologger* library project was born out of the need for a more advanced and flexible logging solution in the VBA ecosystem. It is (heavily) inspired by the PSR-3 standard in the PHP ecosystem and its most recognized implementation, the Monolog library. The goal of this library is to provide similar features and capabilities, particularly by offering a modular architecture that can easily adapt to different use cases. The main idea is for each developer to easily configure and customize their own logging system according to their needs.
